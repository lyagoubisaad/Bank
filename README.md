# Bank account kata

This is the solution I propose to the kata that I was asked to do by Mrs DELFORGE Claire

You will find below the Requirements and the user stories

## Requirements

Deposit and Withdrawal
Account statement (date, amount, balance)
Statement printing
The expected result is a service API, and its underlying implementation, that meets the expressed needs.
Nothing more, especially no UI, no persistence.
